## Project Setup

To get a local copy of **eKitab** up and running on your machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed (LTS version recommended).
- **Docker**: If you're using Docker for containerization.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xetri/eKitab.git
   ```

1. **Install dependencies**:
  
    ```bash
    npm install
    
    # Frontend
    cd eKitab/client
    npm install

    # Backend
    cd eKitab/server
    npm install
    ```

1. **Setup the database**:

    #### Ensure that PostgreSQL is running, or use Docker  to start the database container.

    #### Create a .env file in the backend with your database credentials.

    #### Run database migrations to set up tables.

1. **Set up Cloud Storage**:

    #### MinIO is used to store book files. If running locally, you can start MinIO using Docker:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 9000:9000 -e "MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minioaccesskey" -e "MINIO_SECRET_KEY=miniosecretkey" minio/minio server /data
    ```

    #### Add the MinIO credentials to the .env file in the backend (e.g., MINIO_ACCESS_KEY, MINIO_SECRET_KEY, and MINIO_ENDPOINT).

1. **Run the project**:

    #### For development mode, use the following commands:

    #### Start the frontend:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    #### Start the backend:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
  #### The application should now be running locally at http://localhost:3000 (or your configured port).

### Docker Setup

#### If you want to run the application in Docker containers:

**Build Docker images**:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

**Start the application**:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

#### This will start both the frontend and backend containers, as well as the database and MinIO Object Storage.
